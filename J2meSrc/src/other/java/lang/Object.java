/**
     * Causes current thread to wait until another thread invokes the
     * {@link java.lang.Object#notify()} method or the
     * {@link java.lang.Object#notifyAll()} method for this object, or
     * some other thread interrupts the current thread, or a certain
     * amount of real time has elapsed.
     * <p>
     * This method is similar to the <code>wait</code> method of one
     * argument, but it allows finer control over the amount of time to
     * wait for a notification before giving up. The amount of real time,
     * measured in nanoseconds, is given by:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * 1000000*timeout+nanos</pre></blockquote>
     * <p>
     * In all other respects, this method does the same thing as the
     * method {@link #wait(long)} of one argument. In particular,
     * <tt>wait(0, 0)</tt> means the same thing as <tt>wait(0)</tt>.
     * <p>
     * The current thread must own this object's monitor. The thread
     * releases ownership of this monitor and waits until either of the
     * following two conditions has occurred:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Another thread notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor
     *     to wake up either through a call to the <code>notify</code> method
     *     or the <code>notifyAll</code> method.
     * <li>The timeout period, specified by <code>timeout</code>
     *     milliseconds plus <code>nanos</code> nanoseconds arguments, has
     *     elapsed.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The thread then waits until it can re-obtain ownership of the
     * monitor and resumes execution
     * <p>
     * This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
     * of this object's monitor. See the <code>notify</code> method for a
     * description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
     * a monitor.
     *
     * @param      timeout   the maximum time to wait in milliseconds.
     * @param      nanos      additional time, in nanoseconds range
     *                       0-999999.
     * @exception  IllegalArgumentException      if the value of timeout is
     *                      negative or the value of nanos is
     *                      not in the range 0-999999.
     * @exception  IllegalMonitorStateException  if the current thread is not
     *               the owner of this object's monitor.
     * @exception  InterruptedException if another thread has interrupted
     *             the current thread.  The <i>interrupted status</i> of the
     *             current thread is cleared when this exception is thrown.
