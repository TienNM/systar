/**
 * This is the generic datagram interface.
 * 
 * This is the generic datagram interface. It represents an object that
 * will act as the holder of data to be sent or received from a datagram
 * connection.
 * <p>
 * The DataInput and DataOutput interfaces are extended by this interface
 * to provide a simple way to read and write binary data in and out of
 * the datagram buffer. An additional function reset() may be called to
 * reset the read/write point to the beginning of the buffer.
 * <p>
 * It should be noted that in the interests of reducing space and speed
 * concerns, these mechanisms are very simple. In order to use them
 * correctly the following restrictions should be observed:
 * <p>
 * 1) The use of the standard DataInput and DataOutput interfaces is
 * done in order to provide a familiar API for reading and writing
 * data into and out of a Datagram buffer.
 * It should be understood however that this is not an API to a Java
 * stream and does not exhibit all of the features normally associated
 * with one. The most important difference here is that a Java stream
 * is either an InputStream or an OutputStream. The interface presented
 * here is, essentially, both at the same time. As the datagram object
 * does not have a mode for reading and writing, it is necessary for the
 * application programmer to realize that no automatic detection of the
 * wrong mode usage can be done.
 * <p>
 * 2) The DataInput and DataOutput interfaces will not work with any
 * arbitrary settings of the Datagram state variables. The main
 * restriction here is that the <I>offset</I> state variable must
 * at all times be zero. Datagrams may be used in the normal way
 * where the offset is non-zero but when this is done the DataInput
 * and DataOutput interfaces cannot be used.
 * <p>
 * 3) The DataInput and DataOutput read() and write() functions work
 * by using an invisible state variable of the Datagram object. Before
 * any data is read from or written to the datagram buffer, this state
 * variable must be zeroed using the reset() function. This variable
 * is not the <I>offset</I> state variable but an additional state
 * variable used only for the read() and write() functions.
 * <p>
 * 4) Before data is to be received into the datagram's buffer, the
 * <I>offset</I> state variable and the <I>length</I> state variable
 * must first be set up to the part of the buffer the data should be
 * written to. If the intention is to use the read() functions, the
 * offset must be zero. After receive() is called, the data can be
 * read from the buffer using the read() functions until an EOF
 * condition is found. This will occur when the number of characters
 * represented by the length parameter have been read.
 * <p>
 * 5) To write data into the buffer prior to a send() operation,
 * the reset() function should first be called.  This will zero the
 * read/write pointer along with the offset and length parameters
 * of the Datagram object. Then the data can be written using the
 * write() functions. When this process is complete, the <I>length</I>
 * state variable will be set to the correct value for the send()
 * function of the datagram's connection, and so the send operation
 * can take place. An IndexOutOfBoundsException will be thrown if
 * the number of characters written exceeds the size of the buffer.
